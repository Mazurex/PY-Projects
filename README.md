# Each Project and what they do

### 21.py
This is an unfinished project
### calculator.py
This was my first project, I made it before learning python syntax, to see the efficiency of studying.
### fruit_machine.py
This project was an introductory requirement to my college, it's essentially the "slots" gambling game
### minesweeper.py
This is another unfinished project
### tic-tac-toe.py
This is a project to determine how much I've learnt after 21.py, it includes 3 modes, player vs player, player vs AI, AI vs AI (bugged)

#### Future project will be added here
